See the (GWAS Confluence)[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/GOCI/GWAS+Curation+Utility+Scripts] site for more details on the script and it's usage.

`studies_by_pub.py` takes pubmed id as an argument and prints out/generates a csv with study level info. 

`check_studydesign_sampleinfo.py` provides all information needed for Curation (Level 2) review in a single spreadsheet. The script generates the data for all studies given a PubmedId and includes the study design and sample information.
